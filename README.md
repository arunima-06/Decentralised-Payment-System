# Decentralised Payment System

## Project Description

The Decentralised Payment System is a simple blockchain-based smart contract that enables secure peer-to-peer payments on the Ethereum network. Built with Solidity, this system provides three core functions: sending payments, checking balances, and withdrawing funds.

The platform allows users to send cryptocurrency to others, track their balances, and withdraw their funds whenever needed - all without intermediaries or traditional banking systems.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to democratize financial transactions by creating a decentralized payment infrastructure that is:

- **Accessible**: Available to anyone with an internet connection and a crypto wallet
- **Transparent**: All transactions are recorded on the blockchain and publicly verifiable
- **Secure**: Funds are protected by smart contract logic and cryptographic security
- **Cost-Effective**: Minimal platform fees compared to traditional payment processors
- **Trustless**: No need to trust intermediaries; the code enforces the rules

We aim to empower individuals and businesses worldwide to transact freely without depending on traditional banking systems, especially benefiting the unbanked and underbanked populations.

## Key Features

### 1. **Send Payments**
- Send cryptocurrency instantly to any Ethereum address
- Simple and straightforward payment process
- Automatic balance updates for recipients
- Event logging for all transactions

### 2. **Check Balances**
- View the balance of any user address
- Real-time balance tracking
- Transparent balance information

### 3. **Withdraw Funds**
- Securely withdraw your entire balance
- Direct transfer to your wallet
- Protected withdrawal mechanism

## Future Scope

### Phase 1: Enhanced Functionality
- **Escrow System**: Add secure escrow for trusted transactions
- **Transaction History**: View complete payment history
- **Multi-recipient Payments**: Send to multiple addresses at once
